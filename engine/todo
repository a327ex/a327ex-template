Clipper binding that has PolyTrees so we can merge arbitrary polygons that might have multiple leves of holes in them
https://github.com/lzubiaur/clipper-lua this library would work perfectly but it doesn't have the one feature we want
Use the same method as https://github.com/a327ex/love-steam for building it as a library
  Difficulty: this is easy to do and it's just a matter of spending one or two days doing it

Copy of Tiled editor for more integrated use and additional feature development
Additional features in mind: 
Streamlined placement of rotated tiles on arbitrary polygons
Procedural generation algorithms and integrations
rxi-like autotiling engine
Features to cut from Tiled:
Isometric maps
Maybe the idea of "tiled" maps at all, if the goal is to support arbitrary tiles on polygons then maybe that should be the default behavior and aligned tiles are just a consequence of it
  Difficulty: hard, it will take months until most things are done, so I feel like this is something that should get done slowly over time through multiple projects
